Problem Statement
Title: Enhancing Content Recommendations for Netflix Using SVD

Objective:

In the competitive landscape of streaming services, providing personalized content recommendations is crucial for retaining users and enhancing their experience. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately suggests content to users based on their past viewing behavior and ratings. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the goal is to build a recommendation system that improves user engagement and satisfaction.

Problem Statement:

Netflix, a leading streaming platform, faces the challenge of keeping users engaged by recommending content that aligns with their preferences. With a vast library of movies and TV shows, it is essential to present users with options they are likely to enjoy, thereby increasing watch time and reducing churn. The challenge is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict user ratings for unseen content based on historical data, enabling the platform to offer tailored recommendations.

Success Criteria:

Develop an SVD-based collaborative filtering model that predicts user ratings with an RMSE of less than 25.

Ensure the model effectively captures latent factors influencing user preferences, leading to accurate recommendations.

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MSE and RMSE, with a focus on minimizing prediction error.

Provide actionable insights into user preferences and content trends, allowing Netflix to optimize its recommendation algorithms and enhance user satisfaction.


This model will help Netflix better understand user behavior, improve content discovery, and ultimately increase user retention and engagement, contributing to the platform's long-term success.
